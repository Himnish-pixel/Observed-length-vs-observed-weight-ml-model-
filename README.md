# Observed-length-vs-observed-weight-ml-model-
This project builds a machine learning regression model to predict the observed weight of crocodiles based on their observed length. Using a Random Forest Regressor, the model learns the relationship between length and weight from real or synthetic data and makes accurate predictions on unseen samples.
