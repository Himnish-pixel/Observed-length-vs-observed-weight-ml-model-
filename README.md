🐊 Crocodile Weight Prediction using Random Forest Regressor
📘 Overview

This project builds a machine learning regression model to predict the observed weight of crocodiles based on their observed length. Using a Random Forest Regressor, the model learns the relationship between length and weight from real or synthetic data and makes accurate predictions on unseen samples.

🧠 Key Features

Implements Random Forest Regression using scikit-learn

Performs data preprocessing, training, testing, and evaluation

Visualizes Actual vs Predicted results with matplotlib

Calculates performance metrics such as R² Score and RMSE

Provides a clean, reproducible pipeline for regression analysis

A Python-based machine learning project that predicts crocodile weight from its observed length using a Random Forest Regressor.
It includes end-to-end model building with data preprocessing, training, evaluation (R², RMSE), and comparison plots between actual and predicted values.

🚀 Upcoming Features:

One-Hot Encoding for handling categorical data

Feature scaling and normalization support

Automated hyperparameter tuning for better model performance

Pipeline integration for reproducible training and deployment

This project applies Random Forest Regression to model the non-linear relationship between crocodile length and weight.
It aims to support ecological and biological data analysis using machine learning techniques.
